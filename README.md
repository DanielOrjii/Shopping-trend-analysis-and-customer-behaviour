# Shopping-trend-analysis-and-customer-behaviour
**Project Overview**

The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from Kaggle and focuses on shopping trends. The goal was to identify patterns, trends, and relationships between season, location, age, and gender and how these factors influence customer shopping behavior. The dataset was imported into Power BI, where data transformation and analysis were conducted using Power Query and DAX.

Data Preparation and Cleaning
The data cleaning process was carried out in Power Query to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the dataset for effective decision-making. Key steps included:

Standardizing categorical values: Instances where different terms referred to the same frequency (e.g., biweekly vs. fortnightly, quarterly vs. every 3 months) were unified for consistency.

Removing unnecessary records and duplicate entries to maintain data integrity.

Conducting column quality checks using Column Profile, Column Distribution, and Column Quality tools.

**Data Analysis and DAX Implementation**

Following data cleaning, calculated columns and measures were created using DAX to extract deeper insights, including:

Total Revenue

Average Sales

Average Age

Customer Age Ranges

Top 3 Items per Category

Purchasing Power per Customer

These measures provided a comprehensive view of customer behavior and allowed for more targeted analysis.

**Visualizations and Interactivity**

A variety of visuals were developed to effectively communicate insights:

Bar charts, pie charts, and maps were used to reveal trends and patterns across different dimensions.

Interactive filters were added to enable more granular exploration of the data.

The dashboard design, including wallpaper and theme, was inspired by a YouTube tutorial titled “Transform your Power BI in 20 Minutes” by Power BI Park.

**Insights and Observations**

A semantic inconsistency was found in the purchase frequency column due to varied naming conventions. This was corrected by standardizing terms to ensure accurate reporting.

The Fall season generated the highest revenue despite having fewer purchase occurrences than Spring. This is likely due to:

Back-to-school shopping (e.g., school supplies, kids’ clothing)

Black Friday and Thanksgiving promotions

Quarterly shoppers taking advantage of deep discounts

100% of active subscribers utilized available discounts, with only males being active subscribers.

Cities such as Illinois, with a high number of customers but low subscription rates (24%), highlight the need for targeted loyalty strategies.

**Recommendations**

Targeted Promotions:

Launch more discount programs and advertisements focused on female customers to boost engagement and subscriptions.

Inventory Optimization:

Stock a wider variety of men’s clothing to meet diverse preferences and seasonal demands.

Use top-selling items by gender, age, location, and season to optimize inventory levels.

Leverage Fall Trends:

Expand Black Friday and back-to-school promotions to capitalize on the high revenue potential of the Fall season.

Subscriber Growth Strategies:

Offer incentives such as exclusive discounts, free or discounted delivery, end-of-year raffles, and loyalty programs to increase subscriber conversion—especially in locations like Illinois.

Location-Based Marketing:

Develop targeted marketing campaigns highlighting new products, location-specific deals, and seasonal offers to increase customer engagement.
